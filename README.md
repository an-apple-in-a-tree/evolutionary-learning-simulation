# Reinforcement Learning Agents Simulation

This is a JavaScript-based simulation that uses **Q-learning** and a **genetic algorithm** to evolve agents capable of navigating toward a goal on a canvas.

## Features

- **Canvas rendering** with directional agents and animated learning.
- **Reinforcement learning** via tabular Q-learning.
- **Genetic algorithm**:
  - Selection of top 20% of agents.
  - Q-table crossover and mutation to produce offspring.
- **Interactive UI**:
  - Start/stop simulation
  - Reset environment
  - Live generation counter

## Agent Behavior

Each agent can:
- Move forward
- Turn left
- Turn right

### State Representation
State is defined by:
- **Angle segment** between agent direction and goal (8 bins)
- **Distance segment** to goal (3 bins)

### Reward Function
- Negative reward proportional to distance from the goal.
- +1000 bonus when agent reaches the goal.
